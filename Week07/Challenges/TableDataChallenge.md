# Table Data Challenge
Create an HTML table with at least 3 columns and a header row. Above the table, place one input for each column, and an "Add" button. When the user enters information into the inputs, and clicks "Add", your code should append a new row to the table. Each cell of the new row should contain the text from one of the inputs. After a new row is entered, the inputs should all be cleared.

## Ideas
Your table can contain any type of data you'd like. If you can't think of anything, try making a Basketball Stats table. Each row could represent a player, and there could be columns for name, position, height, career points, career rebounds, etc.

## Styles
Make sure your table looks nice. At the very least, it should have some borders so that each cell is distinct.

## Extra challenge
To make it even more challenging, try to build the entire page in JavaScript. Your HTML file should start with only a button saying "Create Page". When that button is clicked, it should create the table, the inputs, and the "Add" button, and put them all on the webpage. It should also remove the initial "Create Page" button.

## Extra extra challenge (extremely hard)
Allow the user to resequence the rows in the list.
